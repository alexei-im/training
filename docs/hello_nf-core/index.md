# Hello nf-core

<!-- TODO: more detailed intro -->

During this training, you will be introduced to nf-core in a series of hands-on exercises.

Let's get started! Click on the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below to launch the training environment (preferably in a separate tab), then read on while it loads.

## Learning objectives

You will learn to use and develop nf-core compliant modules and pipelines, and utilize nf-core tooling effectively.

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

- Find and run nf-core pipelines
- Describe the code structure and project organization of nf-core pipelines
- Create a basic nf-core compliant pipeline from a template
- Convert basic Nextflow modules to nf-core compliant modules
- Manage inputs and parameters using nf-core tooling
- Add nf-core modules to an nf-core compliant pipeline

## Audience & prerequisites

This is a general-purpose training for learners who have at least basic Nextflow skills and wish to level up to using nf-core.

**Prerequisites**

- A GitHub account OR a local installation as described [here](../envsetup/02_local).
- Experience with command line and basic scripting.
- Completed [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/index.md) or equivalent.
