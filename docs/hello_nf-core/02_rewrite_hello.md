# Part 2: Rewrite Hello for nf-core

In this second part of the Hello nf-core training course, we show you how to create an nf-core-compliant pipeline version of the final pipeline produced by the [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/index.md) course.

!!! note
nf-core tools are pre-installed for you in our training environment.
If you are using a different environment, you need to install the nf-core tools package as described here: https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/installation.
