# Part 2: Rewrite Hello for nf-core

In this second part of the Hello nf-core training course, we show you how to create an nf-core-compliant pipeline version of the pipeline produced by the [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/index.md) course.

!!! note
nf-core tools are pre-installed for you in our training environment.
If you are using a different environment, you need to install the nf-core tools package as described here: https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/installation.

## 0. Side Quest: Workflow of Workflows

Before you get started with nf-core proper, you need to learn how to use an optional feature of Nextflow workflows that is not covered in the [Hello Nextflow](../hello_nextflow/index.md) beginners' course: the encapsulation of a workflow within another workflow.

This feature is covered by the [Workflow of Workflows](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/side_quests/workflows_of_workflows) (a.k.a. WoW) side quest, a standalone mini-course that you can run through in the same training environment.

Go ahead and do that now.

Once you have completed the side quest (or if you are confident you already know how to use this feature), you can move on to the next section.
